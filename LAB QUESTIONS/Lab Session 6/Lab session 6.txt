Lab Q21	
	Write a program that accept marks for students for two subjects and store them in an array. 
	The number of students to be provided by the user
		
Lab Q22
	Write a programme, using arrays, that accepts marks of a test from a number of students marks (the number of students to 
	be provided by the user) and deduct 7 from each. If the resulting mark for an individual is less than 40, it should set 
	the marks to be 40

Lab Q23 
	Write a program that accepts marks for students in an array, the size of the array to be given by the user and 
	compute from the marks, the mean mark, and the average deviation of marks from th mean. 
	Thus if, for example, the mean was 50, the program is to compute the difference of each mark and 50 and 
	add these differences and later find their average
