Lab3
	Study the program

		#include<stdio.h>
		main(){
			int num1; //reserve memory space for num1
			int num2; //reserve memory space for num2
			int sum; //reserve memory space for sum, where you will put the result
			printf("Enter Number 1:\t"); // write on the monitor
			scanf("%d",&num1);	// accepting through the keyboard
			printf("Enter Number 2:\t");
			scanf("%d",&num2);
			sum = num1 + num2;
			printf("The sum is %d\n", sum);
		}	

	Then write yours which does multiplication of two numbers and print on the screen 

Lab Q4
	Write a program that takes from user the radius of a circle 
	and print out the area of that cicle

Lab Q5
	Write a program that prints "Hello Mandela, you are 100 years old" 
	where; Name is entered by user as well as  year of birth from which 
	age is computed

Lab Q6
	Write a program that takes from user the radius of a sphere and 
	print out the surface area of that sphere. Using ternary operators, 
	the progam should first check if the radius is not a number below 0

Lab Q7
	Write a program that takes password from users and check, if password 
	is less that seven, you print "TOO SHORT" otherwise, you print "STRONG"

Lab Q8
	Write a program that takes in Name of a person and age. The requirements are such that name should be longer than 12 characters
	and age to be more than 18 years. If this is true the program should print "THANK YOU" otherwise, it should print "WRONG ENTRY"

	
Lab Q9
	Convert the following program into using a “while loop” in place of the “for loop”.   
		#include <stdio.h>
		main(){
			inti, sum = 0;
			for(i=0; i<10; i++){
				if(i%2 != 0) continue; 
				sum = sum + i;
			} 
			printf(" The sum is %d\n", sum);
		}

Lab Q10
	Write  a C program in which the user enters his/her salary and the program computes the relevant tax according to the table below
		SALARY RANGE			TAX (%)	
		<= 170,000			0%
		170,000 - 360,000		11%
		360,000	- 540,000		20%
		540,000 - 720,000		25%
		> 720,000 			30%
Lab Q12
	Write a program that accept a number of elements of a given array and then compute the mean value of such elements

Lab Q13	
	Write a program that accepts marks for students in an array, the size of the array to be given by the user and 
	compute from the marks, the mean mark, and the average deviation of marks from th mean. 
	Thus if, for example, the mean was 50, the program is to compute the difference of each mark and 50 and 
	add these differences and later find their average

Lab Q14
	Write a programme, using arrays, that accepts marks of a test from a number of students marks (the number of students to 
	be provided by the user) and deduct 7 from each. If the resulting mark for an individual is less than 40, it should set 
	the marks to be 40

Lab Q15
	Complete the following C program to print the contents of the array using pointers
	#include<stdio.h>
	main(){
	int k;
	float thearr[] = {2.5, 5, 6.7, 10, 13.3, 25, 0};
	...
	...
	}
Lab Q16
	Populate the array "multiarr" with the elements in the array "thearr" by multiplying each element in "thearr" by 3.
	Use pointers to do perform the multication of "thearr" array
	#include<stdio.h>
	main(){
	int k;
	float multiarr[7];
	float thearr[] = {2.5, 5, 6.7, 10, 13.3, 25, 0};
	...
	...
	}

lab Q17
	Write a function that takes in year of birth and return a person's age

Lab Q18
	Write a function that takes in a value for radius and gives out the area of a circle

Lab Q19

	Write a function whcih takes in the the side of a square and a choice. If choice is 1 the function should
	return the area of the square while if choice is 2 the function should return the perimeter of the square 

Lab Q20
	Write a function that takes in address of the first address of array and work to multiply all the arrays by 3
	the function should then return the address of the first element for the multiplied array

Lab Q21
	Write a function that takes in two floating point numbers and an integer for option. If the option supplied by the user is 1
	the program should return the product of the floating point numbers and if the option is 2, it should retun the sum

Lab Q22
	- Define a structure that can be used to manage data for computers with attributes; Brand, HDD size, Price and Screen size.
	- Declare an array whose type is the structure you have defined above
	- Using a for loop, write a program that can be used to prompt users to enter the computer records

Lab Q23
